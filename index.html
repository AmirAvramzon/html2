<h3>Some Information About Meatallica:</h3>





<p>Metallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper,
 The Recycler, which read,
 "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."</p>






<p>Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement.
 Although he had not formed a band,
 Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre.
 Slagel accepted,
 and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar</p>









<p>The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.</p>


<p>The band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana,
 who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering MetalMania or Metallica. After hearing the two names,
 Ulrich wanted the latter for his band,
 so he suggested Quintana use MetalMania instead.</p>


<p> Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist;
 Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment.
 In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, "Hit the Lights",
 for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield sang and played both bass and rhythm guitar,
 while Lars Ulrich played drums and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.</p>
